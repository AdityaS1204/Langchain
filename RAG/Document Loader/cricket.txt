I. The Field of Dreams

In lands where sun and willow meet,
Where turf is kissed by morning’s heat,
There lies a field both calm and wide,
With boundless grace and noble pride.
The stumps stand tall, in order set,
Three sentinels the bowler met.
And stretched in white, the batters bold
Hold in their palms a tale retold.

This is the game of bat and ball,
A sport revered and loved by all.
From village green to Eden’s light,
To Lords’ own turf, so pure, so white.
The anthem hums through seasoned air,
A hush, a cheer, a silent prayer.
The leather red, the willow blade—
Together, histories are made.

Let time be turned, and we begin
To chase the game from deep within.
The creak of pads, the bowler’s run,
The rising heat of noonday sun.
Eleven men with dreams intact,
Each bow, each shot, a sacred act.
And in this timeless, noble art,
Beats thumping strong the player’s heart.

II. Origins in Dust and Dawn

It started not with stadium’s cheer,
But fields of rye and cows drawn near.
Where shepherds played with crook and stone,
And rules were whispered, not yet known.
Old England’s plains bore early seeds,
Of cricket born from rustic needs.
They struck the ball, they made a pitch,
And cricket rose from common ditch.

The bat a plank, the ball hand-stitched,
No screens to tell if lines were glitched.
Just pride and wager, sweat and spit,
And heated words when bat was hit.
As decades rolled like spinning seam,
The game grew vast beyond a dream.
From Surrey Downs to Yorkshire's farms,
The sport took root in village charms.

Then Lords was built, the sacred ground,
Where legends echo all around.
Where Hobbs and Grace and Bradman tread,
And batsmen played while thousands said:
"Here is a game that writes its fate,
In overs slow and moments great."

III. The Dance of Formats

Test cricket, stately, proud and pure,
Five days of war the mind must endure.
The batsman grinds, the bowler probes,
The day begins in morning robes.
A duel not of speed, but soul,
Where patience marks the final goal.
To wear the whites is to ascend,
And through long hours, fiercely defend.

Then came the day, the sixties flare,
With colors bright and shorter care.
One-dayers rose, a faster chase,
With runs to make at quicker pace.
And how the crowds began to roar,
As sixes cleared the boundary floor.
Each fifty overs held the key,
To shifting tides and destiny.

Then T20, the latest child,
Where cricket dances, young and wild.
A format swift, a thrilling ride,
Where bowlers fear the batter’s stride.
With music, lights, and fans in craze,
It lights the night in stunning blaze.
Yet though they differ, every style
Still holds the game’s enduring smile.

IV. Heroes of the Game

Let names resound in every tongue,
The ballads of the brave be sung.
Sir Donald Bradman, peerless knight,
Who scored with near immortal might.
His bat a wand, his mind a maze,
He lit the game in golden blaze.

Then came Kapil, India’s pride,
Who led his men with fire inside.
And Imran Khan, with lion’s heart,
Whose team he shaped with perfect art.
Sachin, Tendulkar, God in form,
With strokes that stilled the fiercest storm.
Lara, graceful, West Indies' flame,
Whose bat wrote songs of cricket fame.

Wasim and Waqar, swing’s delight,
Made batsmen sweat in day or night.
Shane Warne, magician of the spin,
Could make the air itself grow thin.
MS Dhoni, calm beneath the stress,
Whose lightning hands could snatch success.

From past to now, the greats arise,
Their names inscribed beneath the skies.
And as we write, the tale expands,
Of rising stars with magic hands.

V. The Bowler’s Alchemy

They stride from far with burning eyes,
Like tempests racing through the skies.
A thunderclap within their soul,
They charge toward the batter’s goal.
The seam held high, the wrist cocked tight,
A flick, a whirl, then sudden flight.
The leather leaves the bowler’s hand—
What follows none could ever plan.

There’s art in pace, in line and swing,
In cutters sharp and yorkers’ sting.
The ball obeys its master's will,
A silent pact, a deadly skill.
A bouncer climbs like mountain wrath,
A toe-crushed yorker stalks its path.
The batsman reads the tale mid-air,
Yet many fall in pure despair.

Spin, the sorcery of flight,
In slow descent, it tests the fight.
The offie teases, floats, then bites,
Leggies turn in looping heights.
The doosra, googly, carrom’s kiss,
A dance of doubt, a deadly miss.
The ball does not just curve or dip—
It haunts the space ‘twixt bat and grip.

Muralitharan’s wrists defy
The laws that bind the earth and sky.
With 800 scalps in spinning thread,
He trapped the mightiest in dread.
And Warne, with ball of '93,
Did bowl a tale of wizardry.
From Shane to Swann, from Ashwin’s grip,
Each turn reveals a captain’s script.

VI. The Batter’s Poetry

But then, the bat—a wand of might,
Defends the storm, absorbs the fight.
Its wielder stands with padded pride,
A knight against the moving tide.
Each ball a question flung with speed,
Each stroke a language few can read.

The drive that flows through covers wide,
A silken thread, a warrior's stride.
The cut, the pull, the lofted grace,
The flick that turns the bowler's face.
Their balance, timing, eye, and flair,
Can break the crowd into fanfare.

Gavaskar, firm and technically blessed,
Held ground while storms did all their best.
Dravid, the wall, unshaken, true—
With every block, the hopes he grew.
Tendulkar danced to records' tune,
A comet lit beneath the moon.

And Kohli, fierce with modern flame,
Chased targets like a lion’s game.
Steve Smith with his twitching style,
Could drive through fear with awkward smile.
And Williamson, serene and deep,
Made silence roar, and mountains weep.

A batter doesn’t just repel—
He writes the song, he casts the spell.
He makes the red ball whisper low,
He sculpts his name in every throw.

VII. The Wicketkeeper’s Watch

Behind the stumps, alert and still,
A sentinel with nerves of steel.
With gloves like whispers, heart like stone,
He waits for fate, unsung, alone.
The nick that flicks a thread of sound,
He hears before it hits the ground.

His hands must move before he thinks,
He leaps before the moment blinks.
A flick to stump, a flash of light,
A batter caught in sudden night.
Gilchrist flew with eagle grace,
And Dhoni’s calm lit every chase.

He chirps and chides with clever tongue,
He lifts the team when nerves are strung.
Though bat and ball may steal the fame,
The keeper’s soul defines the game.
